# Roll 20 Sheet for the Black Sword Hack

Code for a custom character sheet for "THE BLACK SWORD HACK" system, for use in Roll20

There's some dev conveniences that mean you'll have to build the roll20 copy
I like to develop with a server, I've bundled http-server and nodemon as conveniences

To use:
- clone repo
- npm i 
- npm run build

The dist folder has 2 files you'll need to use for roll20:
roll20.html & style.css

The other files in that folder are just for something to look at while developing
